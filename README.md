# Lego and their Colours 

Datalink: https://rebrickable.com/downloads/

This dataset includes information on the themes in Lego and their colours. The dataset also have number of pieces in a set as well. As I am only looking at the colours and themes I will be disregarding anything that doesn't pertain to the colour or themes. 

So what colour does Lego use the most?

My working theory is that Lego uses more black pieces overall in each of its themes.

Here is my Tableau Public accompanying visualization.
